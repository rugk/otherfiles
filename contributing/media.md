## Media use

If you want to use media like text, music, video or other types of media please use [Creative Commomns licenses](https://creativecommons.org/).
Use a [free culture license](https://creativecommons.org/freeworks) so that any use and modification of your work is possible.
If the license of this repository is a copyleft one (like GPL) you should use a "copyleft-like" license for media too, which means use "Share alike" (SA) licenses.
However if this repository is licensed under a poermissive license like the MIT/Expat license you should use permissive licenses too, so do *not* use "Share alike" (SA) in this case.

Generally it is okay to be more permissive by using non-"Share alike" work in copyleft repos, but *do not* use a "Share alike" license in a repository licensed under a permissive license.
